# Lending Club Case Study

## Overview

This case study focuses on analyzing loan data from **Lending Club Case Study**. The goal is to build a predictive model to determine the risk associated with lending to a potential borrower. The model predicts whether a borrower will default on their loan or fully repay it, helping banks to make informed decisions.

## General Information

The main objectives of the LendingClub case study are:
- **Risk Prediction**: Predict whether a borrower will default on their loan.
- **Data Analysis**: Gain insights from loan data, such as the factors that influence default risk.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to explore the following:
- **Interest Rate & Loan Grade**: Higher interest rates and lower loan grades are not associated with a higher likelihood of loan default.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examined relationships between debt to income ratio, and loan grades with loan status.
- **Borrower Profiles**: Analyzed the borrower's income, employment length, loan status and homeownership status.
- **Default Rate Analysis**: Analyzed default rates across different grades.

## Conclusions
This case study provided analysis of Lending Club case study data. Using the predictive model built in this project, we can assess the risk of loan defaults with higher accuracy, providing valuable insights for bank's.


## Technologies Used

The project was built using the following technologies:
- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code development and documentation.
